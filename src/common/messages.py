UML diagramming and reverse engineering for Python.
"""
# ABOUT_FEATURES = """
# Resilient: doesn't import the python files, thus will never get "stuck" when syntax is wrong.
# Fast
# Free
# Recognises inheritance and composition  relationships
# Recognises ocurrences of self.somevar as UML fields (no other UML tool does this for python)
# Detects the cardinality of associations e.g. one to one or 1..*  etc
# Optionally treat modules as classes - creating a pseudo class for each module - module variables and functions are  treated as attributes and methods of a class
# Has been developed using unit tests (supplied) so that you can trust it just that little bit more ;-)
# Can generate UML Ascii-art :-)
# Can generate Java and Delphi code skeletons (out of your python code) so that you can import those into a proper UML tool.

HELP_COMMAND_LINE_USAGE = """
Usage: pynsource -v -m [-j|d outdir] | [-y outfile.png | nopng] sourcedir_or_pythonfiles...

-a generate ascii art uml (default option, no need to specify)
   NOTE: this ascii art is old alpha code - run the pynsource-gui.py
    for superior uml as ascii
-j generate java files, specify output folder for java files
-d generate delphi files, specify output folder for delphi files
-l generate Plant Uml text, specify output png or 'nopng' if you don't want one
-y generate yUml text, specify output png or 'nopng' if you don't want one
   NOTE: run the pyYumlGui.py for a gui interface to this.
-v verbose
-m create psuedo class for each module,
   module attrs/defs etc treated as class attrs/defs
-x experimental test code (devel only)
-p show parse model, no code generated, diagostic

Note: pynsource uses an old alpha python parser.  pynsource-gui.py runs
      a newer, superior, ast based python parser.
