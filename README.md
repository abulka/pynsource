=========

Version number: Version 1.75 (November 25 2019)

Author: Andy Bulka

Overview
--------

Reverse engineer Python source code into UML class diagrams.

Installation / Usage
--------------------

### Ready to run binary apps ###

 * [Mac download](http://bit.ly/pynsource-mac-1-75) (unzip and drag app into the Applications directory) 
 * [Windows 10 download](http://bit.ly/pynsource-win-1-75) (unzip and run the installer) 
 * [Ubuntu Linux 18.0.4 download](http://bit.ly/pynsource-ubuntu-18-1-75) (unzip and run the executable) 
 * [Ubuntu Linux 16.0.4 download](http://bit.ly/pynsource-ubuntu-16-1-75) (unzip and run the executable) 
 * [Linux snap installer](http://bit.ly/pynsource-snap) (install on any distro using Snapcraft) 
 
An affordable, commercial [Pro Edition](http://pynsource.com/pricing.html) is also available with extra features 
like zoom and the ability to drag to connect shapes.

**Note**: Latest snap is 1.76 beta 2 - if you want the latest master (29th March 2020) as an easy to excecute app.  Improvements include better logging and reporting of Python parsing syntax errors.  If you need a Mac or Windows beta binary, please let me know.

### To run from source code ###

You need Python 3.6 or later already installed, and pip3, then simply:

    $ git clone https://github.com/abulka/pynsource.git
    $ cd pynsource
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ ./run

Linux Users: Please use the script `bin/install-linux` to pip install needed dependencies,
including a wxPython wheel specific to Ubuntu 18. Edit the script to change to your version 
number of Ubuntu. Or simply use the prebuilt binaries executables!

What does Pynsource mean?
-------------------------

    Py = Python
    N = and
    Source = Source code

Long Answer: Since it was built in Australia, which is famous for its meat pies and sauce
   at football matches, Pie-and-Sauce.  Where Py = Python and Source = source code.
