# Pynsource

Author: [Andy Bulka](http://www.andypatterns.com)

![Python application](https://github.com/abulka/pynsource/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg)

## Overview

Reverse engineer Python source code into UML class diagrams.

## Installation

[Download](DOWNLOADS.md) - ready to run builds are available for Mac, Windows and Linux.

> Mac users please [right click open](https://www.howtogeek.com/205393/gatekeeper-101-why-your-mac-only-allows-apple-approved-software-by-default/) the first time, 
Mac Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura users need to first `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Pynsource.app`. 
ðŸŽ‰ Easier Technique for Mac Users: Right click on the supplied bash script `fix-permissions.command` and choose "Open" to apply the correct permissions to `Pynsource`.
Then you can copy the app to you Applications/ folder and run it as normal.

An affordable, commercial [Pro Edition](http://pynsource.com/pricing.html) is also available with extra features 
like zoom and the ability to drag to connect shapes.

To build and install from source code, see [building from source](BUILDING.md)

## What does Pynsource mean?

    Py = Python
    N = and
    Source = Source code

Long Answer: Since it was built in Australia, which is famous for its meat pies and sauce
   at football matches, Pie-and-Sauce.  Where Py = Python and Source = source code.

### Run your own PlantUML server
When using PlantUML view (which is not necessary to use the app), if you want to run your own PlantUML server (faster, larger diagrams, more secure), see the Pynsource built in help for installation and configuration instructions.  

### Support the project
Help support the project by [purchasing a Pro Edition license](https://pynsource.com/pricing.html) which contains extra features.  Future plans include
undo/redo and line labels.
