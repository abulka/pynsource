=========

Version number: Version 1.71

Author: Andy Bulka

Overview
--------

Reverse engineer Python source code into UML class diagrams.

Installation / Usage
--------------------

Ready to go binary apps for Mac and Windows are available from the releases download section.
A commercial Pro Edition is also available with extra features like zoom and the ability to drag 
to connect shapes.

To run from source code you need Python 3:
