  Rubberband wxPython app with wxasync clock

  To build this snap:
    snapcraft
  If you get trouble
    snapcraft clean

  Tip: since specifying parts or a step name is not yet supported (as of March 2019) these won't work:
    snapcraft clean rubber-band-async -s pull
    snapcraft clean rubber-band-async

  Install the snap locally
    sudo snap install --devmode --dangerous *.snap
    snap list

  Run
    rubber-band-async -h

  Ignore the warnings Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"
  as these seem to happen to all snaps?

  Publish
    snapcraft login (use ubuntu one auth)
    snapcraft register rubber-band-async
    snapcraft push --release=stable rubber-band-async_0.6_amd64.snap <--- stable release (hard to do)


grade: devel # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels
confinement: strict # use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots

    # SUB-COMMANDS (diagnostic use only)
    # 
    # After building (snapcraft) and installing the snap locally (sudo snap install --devmode --dangerous *.snap),
    # as well as being able to 'rubber_band_async' from the terminal, you can run a subcommand with e.g. 'rubber_band_async.report'
    #
    # Pure Python interpreter invocations that trace imports
    python-v:
        command: python3 -v
    python-vvv:
        command: python3 -vvv
    #
    # For all python interpreter invocations (no script specified), both '' and site packages are automatically in sys path, $SNAP root is not.  
    # Also os.getcwd() is the host's not the inner snap filesystem!
    #
    python:
        command: python3
    # Adding $SNAP explicitly works e.g. '/snap/rubber-band-async/x5',    <--- expected
    # Though, suprisingly also adds the host's local dir to sys path e.g. '/home/andy/Devel/pynsource/Research',    <--- unexpected
    #
    python-add-root:
        command: python3
        environment:
          PYTHONPATH: $PYTHONPATH:$SNAP
    # Adding $SNAP/lib/python3.6/site-packages explicitly works but is unneccesary since site-packages is added automatically. 
    # It just gets moved up to top of sys.path and not duplicated.
    # Though, suprisingly also adds the host's local dir to sys path e.g. '/home/andy/Devel/pynsource/Research',    <--- unexpected
    #
    python-add-site:
        command: python3
        environment:
          PYTHONPATH: $PYTHONPATH:$SNAP/lib/python3.6/site-packages
    #
    # Run my diagnostic script
    #

    report-add-root:
        command: python3 $SNAP/report_snap_env.py
        environment:
